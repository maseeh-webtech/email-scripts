# Email List Scripts

### How to update things:
- Use `emailListUpdate.py` to update all the class lists. Documentation is in the file. Theoretically, depending on the format of the roster given, you should be able to just change the arguments in the `main()` method and it should work fine!

- It does 4 things, depending on what's called in `main()`:
  - Clears all the class year lists (`maseeh-yyyy-private`, where `yyyy` is the graduation year).
  - Clears all the freshmen lists (`maseehN-freshmen`, where `N` is the floor).
  - Rebuilds the class year lists and freshmen lists from scratch.
  
### Notes
- treat exchange students like seniors. (I've just been doing this for the past few years. No issues have popped up, and no one has told me to do otherwise, soooo.... :) )

- Don't forget to add Becky to the frosh list!!

# Email List Scripts

### How to update things:
- Use `clear_list.py` to remove all recipients from the class lists and the frosh-by-floor lists you want to update.
- Use `emailList.py` to update the class lists. Run it 4 times to fill in each of the email lists. You need to alter the following:
  - the roster filename
  - the column numbers of student years and kerberoses
  - the class year you are targetting
- Use `frosh_by_floor.py` to update the frosh-by-floor lists. Run it 7 times on each of the floors (LL = 0). You need to alter the following:
  - the roster filename
  - the column numbers of student years, kerberoses, and room numbers
  - the floor year you are targetting
  - the freshman class year
  
  
### Notes
- treat exchange students like seniors. (I've just been doing this for the past few years. No issues have popped up, and no one has told me to do otherwise, soooo.... :) )
